## 🛠️ Expanding the ESLint Configuration

For **production-grade applications**, we recommend:  
- Adding **TypeScript** for type safety.  
- Enabling **type-aware linting rules** for stricter code quality.

Check out the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for inspiration.
